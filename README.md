# SushiGoRound Logical Model

Welcome to the SushiGoRound Logical Model repository. This repository contains a single `.png` file that details the logical database model for a sushi restaurant management system.

## File

- `Sushi_restaraunt-Logical_Model.png` - This is the main file in the repository and represents the logical model of the database for the sushi restaurant management system. It includes the schema definitions for tables such as Clients, Orders, Deliveries, Feedback, Couriers, and more.

## Using the Diagram

The logical model is presented as an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and is intended for database architects, system designers, or developers who are building or maintaining the database system for a sushi restaurant. The diagram shows the structure of the database and the relationships between the various tables.

### Key Features of the Diagram

- **Entity Attributes**: Each table is listed with its respective attributes and data types.
- **Primary and Foreign Keys**: Primary keys are indicated for each table, along with the foreign keys that create relationships between different entities.
- **Relationships**: One-to-many and many-to-many relationships are displayed to show how entities interact with each other.
- **Constraints**: Details such as `NULLABLE`, `UNIQUE`, and `DEFAULT` values are specified for relevant fields.

## How to Read the Diagram

- Each rectangle represents a table in the database.
- Lines connecting the rectangles represent relationships between tables. The nature of the relationship is indicated by the symbols at each end of the line.
- Key conventions, such as primary keys (PK) and foreign keys (FK), are labeled.
